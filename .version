Capture Version 1.2.0

Major: 1
Minor: 2
Patch: 0

When the code is ready in develop for each release, we create a new branch off of develop named release-YYYY-MM-DD (the expected implementation date).
After implementation we:
- git checkout master
- git merge --no-ff release-YYYY-MM-DD
- git tag -a #.#.#
- git push capture master
